## Membership Pre-Requisites
### Honor System
Pretty straight-forward. You agree to be honest in your dealings with the group and its members. <br /><br />

If you roll low on a skill/ability check/saving throw, don't lie about.<br /><br />

Own it and trust that the DM and other party members will be there to carry the weight.<br /><br />

After all, what's a party for?<br /><br />

### Absence, Tardiness, and Early Departure
Should a player arrive late, leave early, or be absent for any reason, their character will be played by[^1] either:<br />

- a consenting proxy from the existing group.<br />
- the game-runner/GM/DM/etc.<br /><br />

The following source materials are permitted for player use:<br />

### Character Creation
- **Ability Scores**<br />
    - [Standard Array](https://www.wikihow.com/Standard-Array-5e) _(Recommended)_<br />
    Definitely don't do this if you're looking to optimize, but it is a bit faster if you don't mind a more balanced character.<br /><br />
    - [Manually Roll Stats](https://rgbstudios.org/projects/dnd-dice/character-roller) _(Advanced)_<br />
    If you don't like the roll you get, **DON'T re-roll**... Just use the standard array. _(Remember the **[Honor System](#honor-system)**.)_<br /><br />

- **Character Alignments**<br />
    - No evil alignments. The rest of the alignment spectrum is fair game.<br /><br />

- **Inventory Management**<br />
For the sake of everyone's time _(and my sanity)_, we will be implementing the [**Black Hack _"usage die"_ or _"upkeep die"_ inventory tracking system**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/drpy9r/rules_option_upkeep_dice/), with the following dice-to-pack assignments:<br />

    | Pack Type | Die Size |
    | --- | --- |
    | Burglar's Pack | **d6** |
    | Diplomat's Pack | **d10** |
    | Dungeoneer's Pack | **d6** |
    | Entertainer's Pack | **d10** |
    | Explorer's Pack | **d4** |
    | Priest's Pack | **d6** |
    | Scholar's Pack | **d10** |
<br />

### Character Alteration
- **Player Changes.**<br />
After session #0, changes to character build/composition _(not including backstory)_ will be restricted to alterations prescribed for/allowed during level advancement.<br /><br /> 

- **Dismemberment/Disfiguration.**<br />
In limited circumstances where player consent is enthusiastic and ongoing, characters may suffer superficial _(ie. having limited to no effect on the playability of a character from a combat perspective)_ changes to their appearance... Such as noticable scars, loss of hair, etc.<br /><br />

- **Death**<br />
As game-runner/DM, I'll do what I can _(barring any setting-breaking actions)_ to save a character from death. However, something things just can't be undone and _-should we fail-_ a character's death will be given the pomp and circumstance owed to a party member...<br /><br />

- **Resurrection.**<br />
...and then promptly replaced with what-ever back-up character we concoct during the special funeral session.<br /><br />

### Advancement
- **XP vs Milestone.**<br />
I'm sure there are plenty of you who love number crunching XP and counting down the kills until next level... So you should enjoy that when you're running a game.<br /><br />
We, on the other hand, will be enjoying the sweet simplicity of milestone advancement.<br /><br />

- **Multi-classing.**<br />
Go for it.<br /><br />

### Table Etiquette
- **Speaking as your character**<br />
Preferably, this should be your default once game-play has begun.<br /><br />
- **Speaking as a player**<br />
If you need to break scene, please motion to acknowledge you are speaking as the player and **not** as your character.<br /><br />Some simple examples include:
   - _putting your hand on your head._
   - _holding your finger on your nose._
   - _removing a hat or other pre-designated accessory._<br /><br />

- **Inter-Party Conflict Resolution**<br />
    - _**With other players**_<br />
    Really simple... Work the problem out where the problem started.<br /><br />
    - _**With game-runner/DM**_<br />
    If you disagree with a judgment, bring it up before the next session and we'll work it out... But if you just wanna give me grief in the middle of a session and catch these **10d6 lightning bolts**, just say so.<br /><br />
